      <description>Building a Full Data Set. In this demonstration, we have taken the first 97 entries in the Oxford Primary Dictionary and generated 276 new ones by creating complete entries for each root word, inflection, variant and derivative, taking additional information from the Primary Illustrated Dictionary and OED for schools. The below table shows the original entries from the OPD on the left and the entries generated on the right. Future development will refine examples, definitions, and add audio availability</description>
